# hello-world
Getting accustomed to using GitHub...

My name is Todd.  I'm working on getting back into programming from yesteryear (back in the 90s).  I want to create a web app (privately of course to eliminate competition and copy-cats in the corporate world.  Anyway, here I am.  Hope I can reciprocate enough to be considered 'productive'.

this is second time... i was confused somewhere in the comments somewhere. I don't think i edited the code as instructed by the guide.  Also, I get to see how the changes that were merged successfully will remain when I am in a second round of edits to the coding here.
