Getting accustomed to using GitHub...

My name is Todd.  I'm working on getting back into programming from yesteryear (back in the 90s).  I want to learn on my own and create some web apps (privately of course to eliminate competition and copy-cats in the corporate world).  Anyway, here I am.  Hope I can reciprocate enough to be considered 'productive'.
